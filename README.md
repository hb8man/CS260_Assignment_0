1. Linked lists, binary trees, memory alloc, preventing memory leaks, how registers work, .

2. I'm really not good at hard algorithm programming challenges. This is the main weakness I have. I can't wait to get into it. All of the lower level hardware stuff and assembly should be fine in our Computer Architecture class. I think optimization of lower level code is something I need to learn. Most of the stuff I have experience in is in super high level stuff (SwiftUI iOS frameworks). I also suck at pointers, I'm beginning to understand how they work and how double pointers work, but I need more practice with them.
